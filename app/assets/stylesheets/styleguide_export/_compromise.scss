// REQUIRED SUPPORTING STYLES
// --------------------------
//
// Because there is a lot of CSS already in place and ExOpps is not going through a
// full redesign/update, we need to avoid affecting the views in place. 
// Unfortunately, to get the updated look on areas that are within a scope of change,
// we need to compromise and bring in what we can. 
// 
// Obvious examples are around the general and content sass files which would have a 
// wide impact on the site with unknown results, if linked in.
//
// These styles are taken from existing files within the styleguide_export folder, 
// but altered to make them more specific or adaptive to working within the ExOpps
// environment, alongside the old/existing CSS.


// From _general.scss
.verbose {
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  text-indent: -1000px;
  z-index: -1;
