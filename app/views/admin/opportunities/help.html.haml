      %p This guidance aims to help you write an export opportunity that will get published faster.

      %h3.heading-small What we define as an export opportunity 
      %p Export opportunities are sales leads. They are not job descriptions, invitations to invest or property sales.

  %h2.heading-large How to write an export opportunity

%div{:id => 'section-title'}
  .grid-row
    .column-two-thirds
      %h2.heading-medium Title

      %p Start with the country, use a small hyphen (-) and then say what the product or service is in 2 or 3 words. For example, handbags, kitchen equipment, financial advice services. 

      %p Capitalise the first word only and don’t put a full stop at the end.

      %p.message.message-success
        Example of a 
        %b
          good title:
        %b
        Croatia - Kitchen equipment

      %p.message.message-warning
        Example of a 
        %b
          bad title:
        %b
        Spain - Pressure booster/Membrane Nitrogen/Air Compressor Supplier Needed
 


%div{:id => 'section-summary'}
  %h2.heading-medium Summarise this export opportunity in a sentence
  .grid-row
    .column-two-thirds
      %p Start the sentence by stating who the buyer is, for example:

      %p.message.message-success
        An electronics company...
        %br/
        A hospital group...
        %br/
        The government...

      %p Do not repeat the country. This is already mentioned in the title.

      %p Continue with:

      %p.message.message-success
        is looking for...
        %br/
        needs...
        %br/
        wants a supplier of...

      %p You can use 'A tender has been issued...'' if the opportunity is from a public company.

      %p To help with search, do not just repeat the title. Add more information and use different words.

      %p Write the sentence in 140 characters or less including spaces. Don't forget the full stop at the end.

      %p This sentence will appear in the live opportunity as the 'teaser'.


%div{:id => 'section-description'}
  %h2.heading-medium Describe your export opportunity for UK businesses
  .grid-row
    .column-two-thirds
      %p Start the description with:
     
      %p.message.message-success
        It is looking for:
        %br/
        %br/
        Or
        %br/
        %br/
        You should be able to supply: 
     
      %p Then leave a line and list any requirements or specifications such as the volume, size or amount like this:
     
      %div.message.message-success
        \- 6 tonnes of...
        %br/
        \- 180 metres of...
     
      %p Each list item should follow on from the lead sentence.
     
      %p In both instances, you should:

      %div.message.message-success
        %ul.list.list-bullet.margin-bottom-0
          %li use a colon
          %li leave a line break
          %li spell out any acronyms the first time they're used and then just use the acronym if you refer to it again
          %li not use a capital letter at the beginning of each item in the list
          %li not use full stops

      %p Also, remember to:

      %div.message.message-success
        %ul.list.list-bullet.margin-bottom-0
          %li use 'like' instead of 'such as'
          %li use 'to' instead of a dash, for example 50cm to 80cm and not 50cm-80cm
          %li use 'and' not '&''
          %li if listing measurements or similar, don't place a space between the number and the measurement, for example 100mm not 100 mm
          %li use numbers eg '1', '4', '15' instead of writing out in full and use a comma if the number is in the 1,000s, for example 15,000 not 15000
