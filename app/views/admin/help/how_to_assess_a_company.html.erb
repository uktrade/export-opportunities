@article.set_section "Overview", <<-SECTION
  <p>You will need to assess whether a company is both eligible and suitable for the opportunity it has applied for by researching online or using Companies House. Please note, however, that not all companies are registered with Companies House, but this does not automatically make them ineligible.</p>
SECTION


@article.section "Eligibility", <<-SECTION
  <p>You can assess that a company is eligible by checking that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>all relevant company information in its proposal (UK registered address, phone number and <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies House details</a>) is included</li>
    <li>the phone number and address in its proposal, website and Companies House profile all match</li>
    <li>it is actively trading - use Companies House for this</li>
    <li>it has an <a href="https://trade.great.gov.uk/">EIG trade profile</a> - but just because a company may not have one, does not automatically mean it is not eligible</li>
  </ul>
SECTION


@article.section "Suitability", <<-SECTION
  <p>You can assess that a company is suitable by checking that it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>supplies exactly what the buyer wants</li>
    <li>has the ability to deliver the product or service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can do this by checking its:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pitch to see if it provides enough evidence to show that it can meet the needs of the buyer</li>
    <li>website</li>
    <li>online reviews</li>
    <li>EIG trade profile for case studies and so on</li>
    <li>account filing history, how long it has been trading for and annual turnover on Companies House</li>
    <li>annual report - if it's a public company</li>
    <li>previous interactions with DIT as shown in Data Hub</li>
  </ul>
SECTION


@article.set_section "Select a decision", <<-SECTION
  <p>You should be able to decide if a company is eligible and suitable based on its proposal and on your own research. There are 4 replies you can use: 1 'right for opportunity' and 3 'not right for opportunity' replies.</p>

  <p>If you need more information, you will need to contact the company and then make a decision within 5 days from when the company submitted its proposal. If the company does not get back to you within the 5 days, make a decision based on the available information.</p>


  <h3>Right for opportunity</h3>
  <p>If the UK company is eligible and suitable, select ‘Right for opportunity’.</p>

  <h3>Not right for opportunity</h3>
  <p>You should select this decision if the:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>product or service does not meet the criteria of the opportunity</li>
    <li>UK company is not ready to export in this market, or not ready to export at all</li>
    <li>buyer thinks the company is not suitable or the buyer did not select them</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Not UK registered</h3>
  <p>You should select this decision if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a non-UK address is provided and there is no Companies House record</li>
    <li>the Companies House number or UK address do not match with those provided by the company</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Not for third parties</h3>
  <p>Select ‘Not for third party’ if the buyer only wants to deal directly with UK companies.</p>
