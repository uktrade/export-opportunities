# Set up the sections within article
# ----------------------------------

@article.set_section "Overview", <<-SECTION
  <p>This guidance aims to help you write export opportunities. Using this guidance will reduce the time it takes for us to edit an opportunity, which means it will get published more quickly. We define export opportunities as sales leads. They are not job descriptions, invitations to invest or property sales.</p>
SECTION


@article.set_section "Tagging", <<-SECTION
  <p>Make sure that you have selected the correct Country, Sector, Type and Values in the 4 grey boxes at the top of the opportunity.</p>
SECTION


@article.set_section "Writing the 'Title'", <<-SECTION
  <p>Start with the country, use a small hyphen (-) and then say what the product or service is in 2 or 3 words. For example, handbags, kitchen equipment, financial advice services.</p>
  <p class="examples-list-label">Capitalise the first word only and don’t put a full stop at the end.</p>
  <ul class="examples-list">
    <li>Example of a good title: Croatia - Kitchen equipment</li>
    <li>Example of a bad title: Spain - Pressure booster/Membrane Nitrogen/Air Compressor Supplier Needed</li>
  </ul>
SECTION


@article.set_section "Writing the summary", <<-SECTION
  <p class="examples-list-label">Start the sentence by stating who the buyer is, for example:</p>
  <ul class="examples-list">
    <li>An electronics company... </li>
    <li>A hospital group... </li>
    <li>The government...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Do not repeat the country. This is already mentioned in the title.</p>
  <p class="examples-list-label">Continue with:</p>
  <ul class="examples-list">
    <li>is looking for... </li>
    <li>needs... </li>
    <li>wants a supplier of...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can use 'A tender has been issued...'' if the opportunity is from a public company.</p>
  <p>To help with search, do not just repeat the title. Add more information and use different words.</p>
  <p>Write the sentence in 140 characters or less including spaces. Don't forget the full stop at the end.</p>
  <p>This sentence will appear in the live opportunity as the 'teaser'.</p>
SECTION


@article.set_section "Describe your opportunity part 1 of 2", <<-SECTION
  <p>Each list item should follow on from the lead in sentence and in both instances you should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use a colon</li>
    <li>leave a line break</li>
    <li>not use a capital letter at the beginning of each item on the list</li>
    <li>not put a full stop at the end of each item</li>
  </ul>
SECTION


@article.set_section "Describe your opportunity part 2 of 2", <<-SECTION
  <p>When listing measurements or similar, make sure there isn’t a space between the number and the unit of measurement, for example, 100mm not 100 mm.</p>
  <p>Write acronyms out in full if you are going to refer to it more than once and then just use the acronym when you refer to it again, for example ‘The World Health Organisation (WHO) is….’  Followed by ‘as laid down by the WHO’</p>
  <p>Also remember to use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>'and' not '&'</li>
    <li>'to' instead of a dash in ranges, for example '50cm to 80cm' and not '50cm – 80cm'</li>
  </ul>
SECTION


@article.set_section "Company information", <<-SECTION
  <p class="examples-list-label">If the information is available, include one or two sentences about the company, for example:</p>

    <li>where it is based</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Do not give the name of the company.</p>
