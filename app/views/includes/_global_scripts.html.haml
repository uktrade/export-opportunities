-# NOTE: static header-footer was meant to be a temporary workaround solution for areas of
-# the Great.gov.uk site that did not have or support the original ExRed (now pattern library)
-# updated design. Updated Export Opportunity pages running with the global.js file come with
-# support for those original ExRed individual JS files, so the header-footer (bundle) file is
-# not required. Also, the header-footer bundle does not use the proper/original 'dit' object
-# namespace (intentionally for name clash avoidance reasons), so to include the bundle file
-# would result in duplicating some required (dit namespace) JS files.
